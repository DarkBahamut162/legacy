# StepMania 5 Legacy (SSC)

The following project has been in-officially taken over by me (DarkBahamut162).
And I also downgraded this theme as it more looks like how SM SSC looked than the slowly changing 5.0.x release.

It's source is being displayed down below.

I actually could have forked this one as well, but I didn't (for even more bizzare reasons)

What has been fixed so far:

* All **cmd()** transformed to **function(self)**
* "Removed" **StageDisplay** at places (not really needed)
* Reintroduced **SortOrderFrame** & fixed **SortOrderText** in ScreenSelectMusic
* **SegmentTypes** reconfigured for 2-Player in ScreenSelectMusic
* Reintroduces **BPMDisplay** color change on ScreenSelectMusic
* Fixed **ScreenEdit background**
* "Removed" **SM5's pause system**
* Reintroduced **all Fonts** from SM SSC
* Reintroduced **PaneDisplays** for Stream/Voltage/Air/Freeze/Chaos (3rd column)
* Remove Decimals from **BPMDisplay** during ScreenGamePlay
* Fixed and reintroduced **Segments** in ScreenGamePlay that now uses **StepTimingData**
* Lowered **MinSecondsToStep/-Music/-StepNextSong** to ITG times


There still might be things needing a little fix here and there, but since I'm not seeing them, it will stay like this, for now...
