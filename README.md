I actually could have forked this one as well, but I didn't (for even more bizzare reasons)

What has been fixed so far:

* All **cmd()** transformed to **function(self)**
* Fixed **PeakComboAward** & **StageAward**
* Fixed and reintroduced **Segments** in GamePlay
* "Removed" **StageDisplay** (not really needed)
* Reintroduced **SortOrderFrame** & fixed **SortOrderText** in ScreenSelectMusic
* Fixed **ScreenEdit background**
* "Removed" **SM5's pause system**
* Reintroduced **all Fonts** from SM SSC
* Reintroduced **PaneDisplays** for Stream/Voltage/Air/Freeze/Chaos (3rd column)
* Remove Decimals from **BPMDisplay** during GamePlay
* Reintroduces **BPMDisplay** color change on ScreenSelectMusic
* Lowered **MinSecondsToStep/-Music/-StepNextSong** to ITG times


There still might be things needing a little fix here and there, but since I'm not seeing them, it will stay like this, for now...
